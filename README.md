## High-Level Design

## Self-Hosting

Asena is software that does not generate revenue. All features are offered for free.
But for those who insist on hosting their own; The reason bot codes are open source is to help other developers who want to code the bot, to see the working principle and to contribute to those who want to solve the bot's software problems. Other than that, you cannot host the bot yourself in any way. This is a violation of rights.
Otherwise, no assistance will be provided to edit, compile or generate any code in this repository.
